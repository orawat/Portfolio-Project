Weight Allocation Strategy 1:
- Equally weight all stocks

* the data analysis of all of the weight allocation strategies from 2 to 7 would be based on last 1 year's data from the buying date if the holding period is 1 quarter
* another alternative is to use 2 year's data

Weight Allocation Strategy 2:
- If stocks are more than 8:
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)
    - Pick the 8 with heighest weightages
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)
- Else:
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)

Weight Allocation Strategy 3:
- If stocks are more than 8:

    - Minimized Variance (no stock more than 25% weightage and min annual returns as 30%)
    - Pick the 8 with heighest weightages
    - Minimized Variance (no stock more than 25% weightage and min annual returns as 30%)
